Matching game 


<h5> Short paragraph describing project description: </h5>

Matching game is a fun interactive game which uses the coding languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript, Node.js and Jquery. This game is a user-friendly interface where the user starts at the homepage to select “game” to play the game. The user’s screen has 4 shapes: square, circle, triangle, and rectangle. The user selects the “start” button where they are then prompted by a highlighted image of one of the shapes. The user must then select this highlighted image where they then get a counter as a point system for them. That is stored on the leaderboard.  The server runs the same shape and adds one more random one in the next round. The game ends when the user makes a mistake and the screen will prompt “Game over! You Lose!”. Furthermore, there are buttons on the side to change the theme of the page. The game has a difficulty setting: an easy mode and a hard mode.
